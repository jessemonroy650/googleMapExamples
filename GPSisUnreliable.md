# GPS is Unreliable #
Date: 2015-08-12

In the forums I am always reiterating this, today I decide to put some links together to as evidence to this. Into Google I entered [GPS is unreliable](https://www.google.com/search?q=GPS+is+unreliable)

1. **[GPS Evidence Too Unreliable For Legal Purposes](http://www.informationweek.com/location-services/gps-evidence-too-unreliable-for-legal-purposes/d/d-id/1079120?)**
> GPS devices can be easily jammed and their data can be spoofed, particularly when tied to cellular systems, experts argue.

> It seems clear enough that a GPS watch is not very accurate, yet online runners? forums, like one at the Web site of Runners World, are filled with comments from confused athletes who rely on the devices. One poster, for example, ran a half marathon and wore a GPS watch that said the distance was 12.8 miles instead of 13.1.

> When officials began testing the anklets used to track 4,000 offenders in late 2011, they found a variety of problems: cracked cases, batteries that died early, and locations that were off by as much as three miles, according to the Times.

> I have worked on GPS hardware since more then 7 years now. The accuracy reading is also not 100% accurate. Manufacturers state accuracy along with the system used for measuring it. CEP, RMS, 2DRMS, and R95 are some of the systems.

## Sources of GPS signal errors ##
Source: [What is GPS?](http://www8.garmin.com/aboutGPS/)

Factors that can degrade the GPS signal and thus affect accuracy include the following:

* Ionosphere and troposphere delays - The satellite signal slows as it passes through the atmosphere. The GPS system uses a built-in model that calculates an average amount of delay to partially correct for this type of error.
* Signal multipath - This occurs when the GPS signal is reflected off objects such as tall buildings or large rock surfaces before it reaches the receiver. This increases the travel time of the signal, thereby causing errors.
* Receiver clock errors - A receiver's built-in clock is not as accurate as the atomic clocks onboard the GPS satellites. Therefore, it may have very slight timing errors.
* Orbital errors - Also known as ephemeris errors, these are inaccuracies of the satellite's reported location.
* Number of satellites visible - The more satellites a GPS receiver can "see," the better the accuracy. Buildings, terrain, electronic interference, or sometimes even dense foliage can block signal reception, causing position errors or possibly no position reading at all. GPS units typically will not work indoors, underwater or underground.
* Satellite geometry/shading - This refers to the relative position of the satellites at any given time. Ideal satellite geometry exists when the satellites are located at wide angles relative to each other. Poor geometry results when the satellites are located in a line or in a tight grouping.
* Intentional degradation of the satellite signal - Selective Availability (SA) is an intentional degradation of the signal once imposed by the U.S. Department of Defense. SA was intended to prevent military adversaries from using the highly accurate GPS signals. The government turned off SA in May 2000, which significantly improved the accuracy of civilian GPS receivers.
